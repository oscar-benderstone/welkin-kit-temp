Welcome to Welkin, a handy metalanguage for storing knowledge! This kit provides a handy set of tools to analyze Welkin files.
  For a philosophical justification of Welkin as a general-purpose knowledge metalanguage, see explanation.md.

# Background

The Welkin language aims to work with complexity at any scale. Other methods, such as Zettelkasten, do not provide many tools to analyze the inner workings of a concept. Welkin is aimed to fix just that. You can start at any scale, either by synthesizing ideas together or analyzing them. You can definitely integrate the Welkin language with Zettelkasten; with Welkin, you analyze concepts as they are and can determine connections more easily.

The current tool set for Welkin is implemented in perl using the [Marpa parser](https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/). Thank you Jeffery Kegler for your on going work and support for Marpa!
