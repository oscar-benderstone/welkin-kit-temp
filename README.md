# Welkin-Kit-Temp

**Update April 1, 2023 (NOT in relation to April Fool's Day):** I am using a different build tool for welkin-kit and am archiving this git repository. Feel free to reference it, but I will be creating a finalized repository with the correct build tool. Please see https://logsofhumanisticlogic.wordpress.com/ for further updates; they should be regularly posted starting April 9 (or sooner).


*Currently this software is at version 0.0.1 and is in constant development. This software is not yet ready for daily use;
expect many breaking changes.*

*This document, and all others, are still early drafts.*

Welcome to Welkin, a handy metalanguage for storing knowledge! This kit provides a handy set of tools to analyze Welkin files.
  For a philosophical justification of Welkin as a general-purpose knowledge metalanguage, see explanation.md.

# Background

The Welkin language aims to work with complexity at any scale. Other methods, such as Zettelkasten, do not provide many tools to analyze the inner workings of a concept. Welkin is aimed to fix just that. You can start at any scale, either by synthesizing ideas together or analyzing them. You can definitely integrate the Welkin language with Zettelkasten; with Welkin, you analyze concepts as they are and can determine connections more easily.

The current tool set for Welkin is implemented in perl using the [Marpa parser](https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/). Thank you Jeffery Kegler for your on going work and support for Marpa!
